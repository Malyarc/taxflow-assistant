# TaxFlow Assistant — Coverage Matrix

**Status as of 2026-06-02 (OBBBA planning refresh, catalog v1.19.0).**
Inventory of what the calc engine models vs. what's not yet covered.
This is the source of truth for "do we handle X?".

> **OBBBA core conformance — SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (commit `f22c9c1`):** the core

**C-batch v3 (2026-05-27 PM)** — extends v2 with full top-10-state-credit
coverage + bulk PA EIT + bulk OH SDIT + per-K-1/rental sourcing:
- **C2** Expanded to 10 states (was NY/CA/IL): added MA (Senior Circuit
  Breaker / Dependent Member of Household / Limited Income Credit / Lead
  Paint Removal), NJ (Property Tax Credit / Child & Dependent Care /
  Senior-Disabled Property Tax Deduction), OH (Joint Filing Credit /
  Senior Citizen Credit), PA (Special Tax Forgiveness Sched SP / Working
  Family Tax Credit), VA (Low-Income Tax Credit / Credit for Tax Paid to
  Other State), GA (Low-Income Tax Credit / Retirement Income Exclusion /
  Disabled Person Home Purchase), MI (Homestead Property Tax Credit /
  Home Heating Credit). **24 new credits — 31 total state credits.**
- **C9** PA local EIT — bulk-loaded to **~175 PA municipalities** via
  `paEitRates.ts` + `scripts/data/pa-eit-rates.csv`. New `lookupPaLocalEit`
  function with PSD-code AND name-keyed access. Falls back to inline
  LOCAL_TAX_DATA top-13 as fast-path. Locality codes auto-listed in
  `localityCodesForState("PA")`.
- **C10** Ohio SDIT — bulk-loaded to **~226 OH school districts** via
  `ohSchoolDistricts.ts` + `scripts/data/oh-school-district-rates.csv`.
  Supports both `earned_income` and `traditional` bases per district.
  New `oh_traditional` base type in calculator (OH IT-1040 Line 3
  approximation). New `oh_sdit_traditional_base` adjustment for CPA-
  supplied exact value.
- **C11 deeper** Per-K-1, per-rental sourcing — `ScheduleK1Fact.sourceState`
  and `RentalPropertyFact.sourceState` fields added. New adjustment marker
  `part_year_use_full_source_allocation` (supersedes `part_year_use_w2_source`).
  When enabled, K-1 + rental net income flows to source state; intangibles
  still pro-rate to resident state by days (standard residency rule).

**C-batch v2 (2026-05-27 AM):**
- **C2** Top-state credits — Ship NY/CA/IL × 2-3 credits each via new
  `calculateStateAdditionalCredits` (7 credits, refundable + nonrefundable
  flowing through pipeline). NY Empire State Child Credit, NY Child &
  Dependent Care, NY College Tuition, CA Renter's Credit, CA Child &
  Dependent Care, IL Property Tax Credit, IL K-12 Education Expense.
- **C9** PA local EIT — 13 PA municipalities including Philadelphia,
  Pittsburgh, Allentown, Erie, Reading, Scranton + Act 32 default.
- **C10** Ohio School District Income Tax — 15 OH SDs with mix of
  earned-income + traditional bases.
- **C11** Per-state part-year residency — OPT-IN per-W-2-stateCode
  wage allocation (NY IT-203 / CA 540NR Sched CA pattern) via
  `part_year_use_w2_source` adjustment marker. Pure pro-rata default
  preserved.

## 3. Local income tax coverage

Modeled in `LOCAL_TAX_DATA` ([taxCalculator.ts:602](../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/taxCalculator.ts:602)):

| Locality bundle | Count | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **NYC PIT** | 1 | Full bracketed PIT (4 brackets per status) + IT-201 line 48 household credit. NYC School Tax Credit (E8) + MCTMT (E8 tiered SE tax) modeled. NYC EITC sliding scale (G1) modeled. |
| **Yonkers** | 0 | NOT modeled. NY income tax has Yonkers as a flat % of state liability — sub-gap. |
| **MD counties** | 24 | All 23 counties + Baltimore City. Rates 2.25% (Talbot) to 3.20% (Baltimore City + 11 others). Base = state taxable income. |
| **OH cities** | 10 | Akron, Canton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Lakewood, Parma, Toledo, Youngstown. Base = wages_only. **Cross-city resident credit SHIPPED 2026-06-01 s2** (Columbus/Cleveland/Cincinnati = 100% up to own rate via `creditRate`/`creditLimitRate` + `oh_work_city_tax_paid`). |
| **OH school districts (SDIT)** | ~226 | C10 v3 (2026-05-27): bulk-loaded via `ohSchoolDistricts.ts` + CSV. Both `earned_income` (wages-only) and `traditional` (OH IT-1040 Line 3 approximation) bases supported. Inline top-15 fast-path preserved. New `oh_sdit_traditional_base` adjustment for CPA-supplied exact value. |
| **IN counties** | 10 | Allen, Elkhart, Hamilton, Lake, Marion, Monroe, Porter, St. Joseph, Tippecanoe, Vanderburgh. Rates 0.50% – 2.035%. Base = state taxable income. |
| **PA local EIT** | ~175 | C9 v3 (2026-05-27): top municipalities + Act 32 default. Loaded via `paEitRates.ts` bulk registry + CSV. Lookup by PSD code or name. Inline top-13 fast-path preserved. |
| **NYC UBT** | 1 | **SHIPPED 2026-06-01 s2.** `calculateNycUbt` — 4% on NYC-allocated net unincorporated business income (Form NYC-202), after min(20%,$10k) services allowance + $5k exemption, minus the sliding Business Tax Credit. Triggered by `nyc_ubt_business_income`; flows to `nycUbt` + localTaxLiability. |
| **KY occupational tax** | 5 | **SHIPPED 2026-06-01 s2.** Louisville Metro 2.2% (res)/1.45% (non-res), Lexington-Fayette 2.25% (uncapped); Kenton 0.6997% + Boone 0.8% wage-capped (via `LocalityInfo.wageCap`). Base = wages + SE net profit. |
| **CA SF / LA city** | 0 | NOT modeled. SF has no personal income tax; LA has business license tax only. |

**Total modeled localities: ~446** (NYC + 24 MD + 10 OH cities + 10 IN + ~175 PA EIT + ~226 OH SDIT). All but NYC use a flat rate; NYC uses brackets + credits.

## 4. Known coverage gaps — prioritized

Listed in rough customer-frequency order. The top of this list is what to ship next if a paid CPA partner asks.

### Highest priority

1. ~~**PA local EIT** (C9)~~ — **SHIPPED 2026-05-27 v3 — ~175 municipalities loaded via bulk registry.**
2. ~~**OH school district income tax** (C10)~~ — **SHIPPED 2026-05-27 v3 — ~226 districts loaded.**
3. **NYC Yonkers PIT add-on** — straightforward; ~16% of NY state tax.
4. **CA AMT** is modeled (G5); next-highest state-AMT need: NY, NJ, MN if a customer asks.
5. ~~**Part-year residency per-income-item sourcing** (C11)~~ — **SHIPPED 2026-05-27 v3 — K-1 + rental source-state allocation via `part_year_use_full_source_allocation` adjustment.** Intangibles still pro-rate to resident-state by days (standard rule).

### Medium priority

6. **State AMT for NY, NJ, MN** (none modeled outside CA).
7. **NJ retirement-income exemption — refine the cap + phase-out** (currently approximate).
8. **IL dependent exemption** ($2,775/dep — modeled only for filers, not dependents — over-deduction max ~$137/filer).
9. **WI std-ded high-AGI phase-out** (currently uses max value).
10. **IL personal exemption $250k/$500k cliff** — modeled (E1).

### Low priority / deferred until asked

- HI / NJ partial retirement exemptions (partial coverage; sub-gaps documented in [stateTaxData.ts](../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/stateTaxData.ts))
- AL std ded phases out at higher AGI (currently uses max)
- AR complex bracket switching above $89,600 (currently simplified)
- VT dependent personal exemption + Sched IN-112 Part II Line 9 SS exclusion
- KY occupational tax
- NYC UBT
- MD personal exemption per dependent
- OH cross-city employment credit
- IN $1,000/filer personal exemption
- CT pension exemption gradual phase-out (currently approximated as fully-taxing — conservative)
- TN/NH have no wage tax but TN has Hall tax repealed 2021 (✓ correctly modeled as no-tax)

### Out of scope (Phase 4 Option A)

- Trust/estate (Form 1041), partnership (1065), S-corp (1120-S), C-corp (1120), estate/gift (706/709)
- E-filing (CPAs e-file via Lacerte/UltraTax/ProConnect/Drake — by Option A design)

## 5. How to extend coverage

**Adding a new state bracket / std ded:** edit [stateTaxData.ts](../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/stateTaxData.ts), add tests to `tax-engine-50state-tests.ts`, update this matrix.

**Adding a state credit (EITC/CTC):** add a `calculateStateXxxCredit()` in [taxCalculator.ts](../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/taxCalculator.ts) (mirror `calculateStateEitc` / `calculateStateCtc` patterns), wire into the credit-ordering block of `computeTaxReturnPure`, add hand-calc'd tests to `tax-engine-state-eitc-tests.ts` (or new file), update this matrix.

**Adding a new locality:** add an entry to `LOCAL_TAX_DATA` in [taxCalculator.ts:602](../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/taxCalculator.ts:602). For NYC-style bracketed locality, build a separate `calculateXxxLocalTax()`; for flat-rate, the existing dispatch handles it. Update `localityCodesForState()` if state-specific list, update the locality dropdown in `ClientForm.tsx`, update this matrix.

**Adding a new federal form / IRC section:** depends on whether it's a deduction, credit, or alternative tax. Mirror an existing pattern in `taxCalculator.ts` (e.g., `calculateNiit` for an alternative tax, `calculateChildTaxCredit` for a credit). Add hand-calc'd tests in `scripts/src/tax-engine-*.ts` (also add the new test file to `scripts/tsconfig.json` `exclude`). Update this matrix + CLAUDE.md test file list.

**Always** update this matrix when shipping a coverage change.
